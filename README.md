# ml-models
A collection of foundational machine learning models with EDA,Model Creation, Evaluation and implementation.
# Basic ML Models

This repository contains my hands-on learning journey through foundational machine learning algorithms using Python and Colab notebooks.

Each model includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Model training & evaluation

## Covered
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees (Coming soon)
- Random Forest (Coming soon)
- KNN (Coming soon)
